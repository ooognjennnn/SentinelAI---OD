# SentinelAI---OD

**SentinelAI** is an AI-powered cybersecurity platform that autonomously detects, prevents, and responds to network threats in real-time.  

It combines cutting-edge technologies like:
- Vision Transformers (ViTs): For anomaly detection based on network patterns.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL): To simulate dynamic attack scenarios and optimize responses.
- Federated Learning: For secure, decentralized threat intelligence sharing.

### Key Features
1. **Real-time Threat Detection**: Utilizing machine learning to find and prevent attacks instantly.
2. **Autonomous Defense Protocols**: Reinforcement learning agents dynamically build defense strategies.
3. **Privacy-Preserving Collaboration**: Federated learning ensures data privacy while strengthening threat detection.

### Repository Structure (WIP)
The structure will evolve as we develop the project:
